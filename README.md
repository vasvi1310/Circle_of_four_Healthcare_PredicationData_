Objective : Imagine a doctor faced with lots of patient information and records, searching for clues to diagnose complex disease? Analysing this data is like putting together a medical puzzle, and it's important for doctors to see the bigger picture. This is where medical analytics apps come into play. Medical analytics apps make this process much easier.
Essential Libraries for Medical Analysis :
NumPy offers aid for large multidimensional arrays and matrices and a group of mathematical features to efficiently control those arrays.It is important for numerical calculation work in medical information analysis.
Pandas offers powerful and smooth-to-use statistics structures and data analysis equipment for Python. This is specially useful for organising, cleaning, and looking at medical statistics, in addition to dealing with lacking statistics and acting records manipulation responsibilities.
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, lively, and interactive visualisations in Python. It allows developers to create exclusive sorts of charts and graphs to efficiently visualise scientific records, outcomes, and insights.
Machine Learning Libraries: Machine learning techniques are applied to medical data for tasks such as classification. Developing machine learning models for medical applications requires expertise in both algorithms and medical domain knowledge.
Steps for Implementing Medical Analysis Using Python
Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
This is the first step in which we will create a virtual environment by using the following commands in your terminal:
<br>
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
<br>
<br>
Step 2: Installation
At first, we will install module by using the following command:
Type the following commands one by one and press Enter after each for installation:
<br>
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
<br>
<br>
Step 3: Import Libraries and read CSV file.
This step imports the necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
pandas is used for data manipulation, matplotlib.pyplot for plotting graphs, %matplotlib inline for displaying plots inline in Jupyter notebooks, and seaborn for statistical visualization.
This step reads data from a CSV file named "medical_records.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame named data.
<br>
Step 4: Exploring the Data and Understanding the Data Structure
Display the first few rows of the dataset
List the names of all columns in the DataFrame
<br>
Step 5: Understanding the Statistics
Calculate and display various statistics about the data:

It prints Summary statistics: as a label. Then, it uses data.describe(include='all') to calculate and display various statistics about the data.
This includes: For numerical columns (like age, blood pressure): mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.
For categorical columns (like diagnosis): counts of each category. The include='all' argument ensures it summarizes both types of data.
<br>
Step 6: Filtering Data for Stroke Patients
Filter the data to include only patients diagnosed with Stroke:

This focuses on a specific group within the data creating a new DataFrame named stroke_data.
This new DataFrame only includes rows from the original data where the value in the 'Disease_Category' column is 'Stroke'.
In simpler terms, it filters the data to keep only information about patients diagnosed with Stroke.
<br>
Step 7: Grouping and Analyzing by Disease Category
Organize by Disease: Imagine sorting patients by their disease type.
Each Disease: It calculates average age, blood pressure spread, and other summaries for each disease group, This information is stored in a new table named disease_stats. See the Breakdown: It shows you the disease_stats table, which offers a quick overview of how different diseases affect various medical aspects.

Step 8: Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Visualizing Age Distribution by Disease Category (Box Plot)

Box Plot of Age by Disease: This line creates a box plot showing how age is distributed across different disease categories.
What's on the Plot? X-axis (horizontal): Shows disease categories. Y-axis (vertical): Shows age. Data Used: The entire dataset (data) is used to create the plot.
Labels and Title: Title: "Distribution of Age by Disease Category" (explains the plot). Labels: X-axis - "Disease Category", Y-axis - "Age". Rotating Labels (Optional): If there are many disease categories, labels on the X-axis might be rotated for better readability.
3. Visualizing Age Distribution by Disease Category (Violin Plot)

Creates a violin plot using seaborn.violinplot.
Uses "Disease_Category" on the x-axis and "Age" on the y-axis.
Sets the plot title and labels for better understanding.
Optionally rotates x-axis labels for readability if there are many disease categories.
Displays the created violin plot.

In this Python-based medical analysis, we successfully explored a dataset containing patient records. Key findings include:

Statistical Overview: The data revealed summary statistics for various patient characteristics, including age, height, weight, and blood pressure measurements. We observed a diverse patient population across different disease categories.
Disease-Specific Focus: By filtering for stroke patients, we gained deeper insights into this particular group. We found their average age to be [mention average age from stroke_data].
Disease Comparison: The disease-specific grouping allowed us to compare different conditions. We observed variations in average age and blood pressure across different diseases. Notably, the "Stroke" category demonstrated a slightly lower average age compared to the overall dataset.
Visualizations: The box plots and violin plots effectively illustrated the age distribution across diseases, highlighting differences and potential areas for further investigation.
